## Node.js Introduction

### What is Node.js?

Node.js is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. It allows developers to run JavaScript code on the server side, enabling the creation of scalable and high-performance web applications.

### Key Features of Node.js

- **Asynchronous and Event-Driven**: Node.js uses non-blocking I/O operations, making it efficient and suitable for real-time applications.
- **Single-Threaded**: It operates on a single-threaded event loop, which can handle multiple connections concurrently.
- **Cross-Platform**: Node.js can run on various operating systems, including Windows, macOS, and Linux.

### Common Use Cases

- Web servers and APIs
- Real-time applications (e.g., chat applications, online gaming)
- Command-line tools
- Microservices architecture

## Asynchronous Programming in Node.js

### Callbacks

Callbacks are functions passed as arguments to other functions, which are invoked after a certain operation is completed

### Promises

Promises represent the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation and its resulting value.

### Async/Await

Async/Await is syntactic sugar built on top of Promises, allowing for cleaner and more readable asynchronous code.

## Built-in Modules in Node.js

### File System (fs)

The `fs` module provides an API for interacting with the file system, allowing you to read, write, and manipulate files.

### HTTP

The `http` module allows you to create web servers and handle HTTP requests and responses.

### Path

The `path` module provides utilities for working with file and directory paths.

### OS

The `os` module provides operating system-related utility methods and properties.
